A very old (but still very handy) project that I've been using for years to convert my FLAC encoded audio files to AAC for use on other devices. I developed it when no existing solutions could do exactly what I wanted.

Has dependencies on a number of external executables to provide the actual transcoding and metadata management; this project only provides the skeleton.

As a caveat, this reflects my understanding of Java about seven years ago, and it needs a lot of work, perhaps uploaded it will motivate me to work on that.
